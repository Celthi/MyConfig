This folder contain the config files I use, such VIM, ZSH, 

1. vimrc in Windows and Ubuntu(Linux)

	.vimrc for Linux
	_virmrc for Windows

My goal is to a vimrc for Mac, haha, you know that mean.

2. My zsh config file.

	It is borrow form the internet, I can't find the sources, sorry.

	As a tip, when using such tool, It is a good way to use others config files for the start. When you has master the tool or the need to change the file to suite your need.
